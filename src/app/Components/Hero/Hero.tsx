        The hero section of a website is the first visual and textual impression visitors see. It typically includes a striking image or background, a compelling headline, and a call-to-action (CTA) that directs users towards the siteâ€™s main goal. The purpose of the hero section is to capture attention, convey the brand message quickly, and invite users to engage further with the content. This section should be visually engaging and clearly communicate the value proposition to ensure users stay and explore the site.</p>
